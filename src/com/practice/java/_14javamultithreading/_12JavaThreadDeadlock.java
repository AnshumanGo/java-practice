/*
 * These are some of the guidelines using which we can avoid most of the deadlock situations.
 * ***Avoid Nested Locks: This is the most common reason for deadlocks, avoid locking another resource if you already hold one.
 * It’s almost impossible to get deadlock situation if you are working with only one object lock.
 * For example, another implementation of run() method without nested lock and program runs successfully without deadlock situation.
 * ***Lock Only What is Required: You should acquire lock only on the resources you have to work on,
 * for example in above program I am locking the complete Object resource but if we are only interested in one of it’s fields,
 * then we should lock only that specific field not complete object.
 * ***Avoid waiting indefinitely: You can get deadlock if two threads are waiting for each other to finish indefinitely
 * using thread join. If your thread has to wait for another thread to finish, it’s always best to use join with maximum
 * time you want to wait for thread to finish.*/

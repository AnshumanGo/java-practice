    *  If you make any static method as synchronized, the lock will be on the class not on object.
       Problem without static synchronization
       * Suppose there are two objects of a shared class(e.g. Table) named object1 and object2.
       * In case of synchronized method and synchronized block there cannot be interference between
       * t1 and t2 or t3 and t4 because t1 and t2 both refers to a common object that have a single lock.
       * But there can be interference between t1 and t3 or t2 and t4 because t1 acquires another lock
       * and t3 acquires another lock.I want no interference between t1 and t3 or t2 and t4.
       * Static synchronization solves this problem. */

 * IPC is allowing synchronized threads to communicate with each other.
 * It is done using following methods of Object class
 * 1) wait() method : Causes current thread to release the lock and wait
 * until either another thread invokes the notify() method or the notifyAll()
 * method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed.
 * 2) notify() method : Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
 * If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them is chosen to be awakened.
 * 3) notifyAll() method : Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor*/

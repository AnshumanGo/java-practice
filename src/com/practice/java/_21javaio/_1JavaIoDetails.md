Java has different set of input and out file read write mechanism.

Common logic:
1. Any output stream class is similar as any writer class which is used to write data of any external file.
2. Any input stream class is similar as any reader class which is used to read data from any external file.

Depending on different use case different Java IO files are used.
Depending on most common use case, will work on those only relative Java IO files examples.
